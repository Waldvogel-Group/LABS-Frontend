The Project is still in the development phase, so there are some features that are not yet implemented. 

Since the API connection between the User-Interface and the Twisted Backend is not secured yet, we do not recommend use case open to the local or wide network under any circumstances yet. 
We tested the project, where the host for user interface and backend was the same computer. 
If an installation with several backends is to be realized at this time, we recommend putting the applications behind a reverse proxy and securing access with a firewall. 
We plan to secure the API communication for a later release. 

'WTF_CSRF_ENABLED' = False in config.py is used to disable CSRF protection. This is not recommended for production environments.
